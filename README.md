# ItemCollisionSound
A Simple Mod that plays a sound every time an item collides with a block.

## Known Issues
- Only Detects Collisions with Solid Blocks. (Only Full blocks, no slabs, stairs, fences, etc.)
- When drop on the edge of a block it doesn't play a sound since the Block underneath the center of the Item Entity is Air.

I may or may not fix these. This mod is mainly an experiment.
